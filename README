****
IC includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified implementation to work with the IC codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument.  It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.

IC is dependent upon libsecp256k1 by sipa, the sources for which can be found here:
