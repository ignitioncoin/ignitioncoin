:::: Upgrading on Windows 7/8.1/10 ::::

Your default data directory is in the folder %AppData%\Ignition, you can reach it by pasting %AppData% into your windows
explorer address bar - This folder contains your wallet*, the chain data, and your configuration files.

First, we want to backup the important files from the data directory. Turn off any running Ignition wallet on your PC, and
make a new folder on your desktop or elsewhere to store your backup files.

Then, go to %appdata%\Ignition\ folder, and copy these important files to your backup folder:
wallet.dat, Ignition.conf, and masternode.conf (if it exists)

Now, you can delete the data directory. Click the Folder ^up button or type %appdata% in the address bar. Then,
delete the Ignition folder. (Make sure you have backed up your wallet.dat or you WILL LOSE YOUR COINS!!)

Now that your data directory is deleted, you can run the latest wallet. It is a `.exe` file and you can get the latest here:
https://github.com/ignitioncoin/ignitioncoin/releases  (use the one with the highest version number)

When you run it, it will then sync, this may take a while. Once fully synced, shut it down. You can check if it is
synced using the explorer, https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ic/

Then, copy the backed up wallet and configuration files into the new Ignition data directory, by dragging your backed up
files into %appdata%\Ignition folder.

Now, run Ignition-qt again, and your all set , with old wallet and configurations.
