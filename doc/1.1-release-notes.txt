1/ Fork height is set to 225,000th block - This is estimated to be early august. No changes will occur on the network
(including POW algo change) until after this block height.

2/ ASIC Miners will no longer be compatible miners for $IC. Only GPUs and some CPUs will have good mining results after
the fork height (block 225,000). This is due to the change from Scrypt (ASIC Algorithm) to Neoscrypt (ASIC-Resist
Algorithm). We hope this will increase decentralization even more.

3/ There are many scripts added to the `reporoot/scripts` folder of the repo. These scripts can do a lot of things,
check their name for a good start to what they do - and if you have any questions on how to use them, visit discord
chat here: https://discord.io/Ignition

4/ If you upgrade after the fork height (225,000th block), you *must* re-sync the blockchain data by deleting it (while
keeping your wallet.dat & configurations backed up).

5/ Nodes that run v1.0.0.3 or prior after the forkheight, 225,000th block, will be disconnected from upgraded nodes.
Any earnings on nodes that stay on old nodes will not be credited when they do upgrade their wallet, but coins earned
prior to the fork height will be safely stored in the same wallet.dat file.

6/ Masternodes can no longer use the "RewardAddress" and % configurations to send portions or all of their masternode
rewards to external addresses - This is to improve the structure of masternodes to be more hardened.
